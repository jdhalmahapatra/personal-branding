<h2>The Future is on the Edge</h2>

<p>Traditionally, web applications have been deployed to servers in a specific region. This means that users who are far away from that region will experience higher latency. Edge computing solves this problem by deploying code to a global network of data centers, so that it's always close to the user.</p>

<p>Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform that allows you to run JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly on Cloudflare's global network. This has a number of advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance</strong>: Code runs closer to the user, reducing latency.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The network automatically scales to handle traffic.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost</strong>: You only pay for what you use.</li>
</ul>

<p>We recently used Cloudflare Workers to build a real-time analytics dashboard. The application required low-latency data ingestion and processing from users all over the world. By deploying our data processing logic as a Cloudflare Worker, we were able to achieve sub-second latency for 99% of our users. The Worker receives data from the client, performs some initial processing and aggregation, and then forwards it to a central database for storage and further analysis. This architecture proved to be highly scalable and cost-effective. The developer experience was also excellent, with a simple CLI and a generous free tier for getting started.</p>
